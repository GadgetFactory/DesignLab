Final Macro Processing ...

Processing Unit <Papilio_Pro> :
	Found 3-bit shift register for signal <XLXI_60/Inst_core/Inst_muldex/output_block.a_2>.
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 8-bit shift register was found for signal <XLXI_56/tdo_mem_7> and currently occupies 8 logic cells (4 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
