      sketchdir://circuit/PSL_Papilio_Pro_LX9.xise
      sketchdir://circuit/PSL_Papilio_DUO_LX9.xise
      sketchdir://circuit/PSL_Papilio_One_500K.xise
      sketchdir://circuit/PSL_Papilio_One_250k.xise
  3) Define your Arduino style library
      Modify the .cpp and .h tabs of this sketch
  4) Make an example sketch for the library
      Open the sketch under the examples folder - it should have automatically opened with this sketch.
  4) Share your library
