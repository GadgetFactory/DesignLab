  SD card read/write
 
 This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file 	
 The circuit:
 A microSD Wing connected to AL ( http://www.papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.MicroSDWing )
 or
 A RetroCade MegaWing ( http://retrocade.gadgetfactory.net/index.php?n=Main.RetroCadeMegaWing )
 
 Soft Processor:
 This example is for the ZPUino Soft Processor, it will work with any variant that has SPI connected to Wishbone slot 6 such as the Hyperion variant.
